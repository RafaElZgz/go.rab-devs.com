## Requirements to fork/work on this project

- Front end:
  - Knowledge in:
    - Nuxt v2 basics
    - Tailwind CSS
    - HTML (obviously)
    - JSON and JS (for translations and other stuff)
- Back end:
  - Basic knowledge of Strapi v3 and having an operative API to connect to. You will need to modify your Strapi project to fit this project needs. I recommend reading [this guide](https://docs-v3.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/guides/api-token.html#introduction). You can also use your own API as long as you modify the code.
  - Knowledge in:
    - JSON
    - REST API Calls (Axios and @nuxtjs/strapi)
    - JavaScript (very important) and know how to handle with TypeScript.
